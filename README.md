A lightweight API service that extracts structured **Markdown content** from any recipe webpage ‚Äî removing ads, comments, menus, newsletter boxes, and keeping **only the essential recipe information**.

This project is part of a broader ecosystem designed to power a recipe bot (importing, organizing, and storing cooking recipes from various sources).

## üîç What it does

Given the URL of a recipe page, the service fetches and parses the HTML using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/), cleans the page from non-essential elements using a set of custom DOM heuristics, and returns the **title**, **thumbnail**, and **main content** as clean Markdown.

‚úÖ Works with virtually **any cooking website**.  
‚úÖ Headless browser rendering via Chromium.  
‚úÖ Ideal for clean storage or downstream processing.


## ‚ö° Quickstart (API usage)

**Endpoint:**

`GET /url-to-markdown?url={RECIPE_URL}`

**Example:**

`http
GET http://localhost:3000/url-to-markdown?url=https://www.marmiton.org/recettes/recette_bo-bun-vietnam_26967.aspx`


**Response:**


```json
{   
"title": "Bo Bun (Vietnam)",   
"thumbnail": "https://assets.afcdn.com/recipe/20180504/79026_w1024h768c1cx3000cy2000.jpg",   
"content": "## Bo Bun (Vietnam)\n4.7/5\n+ 11\n35 min\n‚óè\nfacile\n‚óè\nbon march√©\nIngr√©..."
}
```


## üß† How it works

This project uses [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) to render the recipe page and run cleaning scripts inside the browser. DOM-based filters remove unneeded content.
For instance, the service loads the page in a headless browser and removes ads, comments, and other noise before converting to markdown.

## üöÄ Run with Docker

You can run the service directly using the latest Docker image:

`docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 ghcr.io/dorianrod/html-recipee-to-markdown:latest`

Then call the API at [http://localhost:3000/url-to-markdown?url={recipee_url}](http://localhost:3000/url-to-markdown?url={recipee_url}).
